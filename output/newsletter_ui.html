          </h3>

          <div style="color:#d2e7ff; line-height:1.6;">*   Vertical video production studios are increasingly disrupting the traditional entertainment industry.
*   Past ventures like Quibi and Go90, which attempted short-form, mobile-first content, failed due to high costs, confusing branding, and lack of shareability.
*   The concept of smartphone-optimized scripted series gained significant traction in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, proving its viability.
*   Modern "micro drama" companies like DramaBox and ReelShort are now successfully monetizing this content, demonstrating how previously failed ideas can thrive with evolving media consumption habits.
*   These platforms integrate features from social media and streaming services, offering two-minute episodes often focused on pulpy romance, revenge narratives, and specific cultural themes.</div>

              US may owe $1 trillion in refunds if SCOTUS cancels Trump tariffs

          </h3>

          <div style="color:#d2e7ff; line-height:1.6;">*   A potential Supreme Court ruling against former President Trump's tariffs could obligate the US government to refund companies up to $1 trillion in import fees.
*   The technology sector faces particularly high stakes, as these tariffs have been linked to disruptions in global supply chains and a potential dampening of innovation.
*   The Supreme Court is currently deliberating two cases challenging the President's unilateral authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
*   Following recent oral arguments, prediction markets indicate a significant drop in Trump's odds of winning, attributed to apparent skepticism from Supreme Court justices.
*   Economists argue that trade deficits are a normal economic phenomenon, often signifying a foreign investment surplus rather than national decline, and are not inherently problematic as Trump has contended.</div>

*   In a prior September meeting, the panel attempted to alter recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine, specifically delaying the birth dose.
*   This proposed change was abandoned after panel members questioned the lack of data supporting the safety or efficacy of delaying the birth dose.
*   The hepatitis B vaccine, including its birth dose, is crucial for preventing chronic liver infection and has no significant safety concerns, according to CDC data.</div>

          <div style="color:#d2e7ff; line-height:1.6;">*   Dr. Jan M. Engelmann's research challenges the long-held belief that rationality is exclusive to humans by demonstrating that chimpanzees possess a sophisticated capacity to revise their beliefs based on conflicting evidence. The study found that chimps successfully altered their initial choices when presented with strong counter-evidence, particularly when the initial evidence was weak, indicating a nuanced processing of information where the strength and order of evidence significantly influence their decisions.

*   Chimpanzees exhibit a sophisticated capacity for rationality, challenging the traditional view of it as exclusively human.
*   The study focused on their ability to revise beliefs based on evidence, a key indicator of rational thought.
*   Chimps successfully altered their initial choices when presented with strong counter-evidence.
*   Their decision to revise beliefs was significantly influenced by the strength and sequence of the evidence received.
*   This research suggests that the evolutionary origins of rational processing of conflicting information are shared with other primates.</div>

              How Genes Have Harnessed Physics to Grow Living Things
            </a>
          </h3>

          <div style="color:#d2e7ff; line-height:1.6;">Recent biophysical research indicates that mechanical forces, specifically the Marangoni effect, play a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in establishing the head-and-tail axis. This discovery signifies a broader shift in biological understanding, moving beyond solely genetic and chemical explanations to integrate the critical influence of mechanical forces. Modern imaging and measurement techniques have enabled scientists to observe these forces directly, fostering a renewed appreciation for historical perspectives that emphasized physics in shaping living organisms. The current scientific focus is on elucidating the complex interplay between genetic instructions and physical mechanics in biological sculpting.

*   The Marangoni effect, known for phenomena like wine tears, is now identified as a key mechanical force in establishing an embryo's head-and-tail axis.
*   Biology is increasingly recognizing the significant role of mechanical forces in growth and development, complementing traditional genetic and chemical explanations.
*   Advances in imaging and measurement technologies have enabled direct observation and analysis of these mechanical forces in live biological processes.
*   This shift revives interest in pre-genetic models, such as D'Arcy Thompson's work, which highlighted the influence of physics on biological forms.
*   Future research aims to understand the intricate interplay and collaboration between genetic instructions and physical mechanics in sculpting organisms.</div>
